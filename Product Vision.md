# Cloud Infrastructure has changed

Cloud-native architectures have caused a change in the way companies operate their infrastructure. What used to be manual processes and ITIL practices is now infrastructure-as-code and self-service automation.

Developers are in the driver's seat - they determine what cloud services they want to use, and spin up resources as needed. The goal is feature velocity, and to ship new digital products faster. But - the larger and more distributed an organization gets, the more challenges these new dynamic environments create.

CI/CD pipelines and tear down jobs fail. Things break and don’t get cleaned up - the result is drift, and a rising cloud bill. Despite garbage collection, “stuff” is leaking. Artifacts get left behind, growing the number of orphaned resources. It’s not just servers, databases and VPCs. It’s also things like accounts, SSH keys, IAM policies, roles and certificates, volumes and their snapshots and dynamic IP addresses. It’s a long tail of resources.
